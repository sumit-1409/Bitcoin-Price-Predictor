# Bitcoin-Price-Predictor
Developed a web application that predicts Bitcoin prices using historical data and basic machine learning techniques
and real world data.
• Integrated a Python backend with a prediction model to forecast future Bitcoin price trends based on past
patterns.
• Visualized price data and predictions with interactive charts and graphs, providing users with clear insights.
• Used React for the frontend and Flask to serve prediction APIs, with data stored in local storage for user session
persistence
